1. Be nice, patient and respectful to everyone, especially if you encounter people who may be less skilled than you in this specific topic.

2. If there come across people who are unpatient and violate the rules, hint them nicely to their misconduct and report it to a moderator or staff member with a proof in form of a message ID, message link or, in best case, a screen shot.

3. **Any type** of self-promotion for any type of product or service isn't allowed and will be hardly punished. If you want to advertise a product or service, you need to get an agreement of a **staff member**.

4. Publishing any type of anti-constitutional (related to german and european law) is not allowed and will be hardly punished. Posting any type of NSFW content in not-NSFW-marked channels is also forbidden, will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.

5. Usernames must be readable and pingable and must of course follow the rules.

6. Abusement of your permissions and roles, also referred to the usage of bots, will result in a penalty and loss of your permissions and roles.

7. Abusing bugs in bots to ping everyone, kick/ban members or violate any rules is forbidden.

8. Any type of spam, the excessive use of caps or anything similar is not allowed and will be removed.

9. Of course, you should observe the [Discord TOS](https://discordapp.com/terms) and the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines).

10. Do not argue with, impersonate, or spam staff in the server or off the server (dms, mutual servers, etc). You have to follow the instructions of moderators and staff members.

11. Invite Links, for self promotion or not, are only allowed over DM when asked. Otherwise ask a Staff Member for the permission to post it. 

12. The channels located in the **blackboard** category mustn't be used for shitposting, only messages that are meant serious are allowed there, thus a message not complying with this rule, will be deleted by the **staff team** and the user breaking this rule will be warned.
