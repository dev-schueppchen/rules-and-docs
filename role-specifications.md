This applies to every role:  
**Abusing any right of your role and permission will instantly result in a loss of your role.** If you are prospectively inactive for a longer time span, you must inform the staff team about this, if possible. Otherwise, long term inactivity may will cause a loss of your role.

## Admin

Ad Administrator *(short `Admin`)*, your primary responsibility is to take care of the staff team. That means in particular, you will execute promotions and demotions of Moderators if they act against the law or if they want to. Also, you may need to organize team meetings if the owners are not available to do so. This does not mean that you can not perform actions Moderators are resposible for like reporting, muting, kicking or banning members, but it is not your **primary** task.

Also, of course, you will have full administrative permissions on the guild, which also implies that you **must** have [MFA](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication) enabled.
    
## Moderator

Moderators are generally resposible for reporting, muting, kicking and banning members if they act against the [general rules](general-rules.md). Each of these actions must be performed through the report system of [shinpuru](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru) *(Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru/wiki/Commands#moderation))* and **must be wel ldocumented**. This means in particular that you need to pass screen shots, links or everything that is valid as proof for the offence, if possible. If the report system fails, for some reason, these actions can be performed via the regular Discord moderation tools.

The type and degree of punishment which needs to be applied for a rule violation is defined in the [punishment guidelines](punishment-guidelines.md) and must be followed as documented there.

Moderators are also responsible to control and overwatch the actions of other staff members, including Admins. If a staff member acts against the [general rules](general-rules.md) as well, this must be reported as same as with non-staff users.
